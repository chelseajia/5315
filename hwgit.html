      <h2>a.  What is GIT? Why do we need source code Version Control System?</h2>
      <p>Git is a version control system that is used for software development and other version control tasks. As a distributed revision control system it is aimed at speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.</p>
      <p>Changes, commits, history, a repository, diffs and branches are all typically provided by version control systems. These features enable workflows where changes are logged for future reference, work can be be done in parallel and previous versions of files are kept.</p>

      <h2>b.  Describe following terms: 1) local repo 2) remote repo 3) how to use GIT in Team Project – multiple developers work on the same project at the same time</h2>
      <p>1) Local repo: the local repo is on your computer and has all the files and their commit history, enabling full diffs, history review, and committing when offline.</p>
      <p>2) Remote repo: the remote repo is usually not on your machine and is the one shared by the team. The team “pushes” commits to it when ready to share with the team.</p>
      <p>3) How to use GIT in Team Project: </p>
      <p>First, someone in the group need to create a central repository. Next, each developer creates a new branch to work on, making sure that it is up to date with the master branch. Once the repository is cloned locally, a developer can make changes using the standard Git commit process: edit, stage, and commit. After the developers add and commit their files, they can push the changes to their branch on GitHub.  If developers are ready to merge their branches' code with the master branch, make a pull request.</p>
